There are several agricultural technologies used in developed economies that can be replicated in developing countries like Kenya to boost agricultural production. Here are some of them:

1. **Drip Irrigation**: This method of irrigation, which originated in Israel, is highly efficient and requires 20-50% less water than other irrigation methods. It involves slowly applying water to the plant roots, reducing water wastage due to evaporation or runoff. The N-Drip micro-irrigation system, which reduces the costs for expensive pumps and water filters, is an example of an advancement in this technology [Source 1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-advanced-countries-agriculture-140128710.html).

2. **Hydroponics**: This is a method of growing plants without soil, instead using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent. An example is the Spread company in Japan that produces hydroponically grown lettuce [Source 1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-advanced-countries-agriculture-140128710.html).

3. **Sensor-Based Systems for Irrigation**: These systems monitor the water needs of crops and adjust the irrigation accordingly, reducing water waste. The Routerek company in Japan has developed such systems [Source 1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-advanced-countries-agriculture-140128710.html).

4. **Insect Cultures for Nutrient Sources**: Companies like Ynsect in France are developing insect cultures that convert cereals into nutrient sources for pet feed [Source 1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-advanced-countries-agriculture-140128710.html).

5. **Production and Supply of GMO and Non-GMO-Based Seeds**: Companies like Limagrain in France are involved in the production and supply of GMO and non-GMO-based seeds [Source 1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-advanced-countries-agriculture-140128710.html).

6. **Insect-Based Organic Fertilizers**: Agronutris, a French company, is a manufacturer of insect-based organic fertilizers [Source 1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-advanced-countries-agriculture-140128710.html).

Implementing these technologies in Kenya requires a multi-faceted approach:

- **Building Digital and Human Bridges**: Digital platforms that bundle agricultural services for easy access and use can help increase the uptake of these technologies. At the same time, human bridges are also needed that link service users and providers. This can involve training programs, workshops, and on-site demonstrations to educate farmers about these technologies and how to use them effectively [Source 17](https://theconversation.com/digital-solutions-are-boosting-agriculture-in-kenya-but-its-time-to-scale-up-heres-how-192422).

- **Addressing Infrastructure and Capacity Challenges**: Poor infrastructure and the low capacity of potential users are major challenges to the adoption of these technologies. It's important to invest in infrastructure development and capacity-building initiatives to overcome these challenges [Source 24](https://agricultureandfoodsecurity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40066-022-00364-7).

- **Improving ICT Policies**: Poor ICT policies can also hinder the adoption of these technologies. Policymakers need to prioritize ICT initiatives, strengthen monitoring, and improve the implementation and integration of ICT within the agricultural sector [Source 24](https://agricultureandfoodsecurity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40066-022-00364-7).

By adopting these technologies and addressing these challenges, Kenya can significantly increase its agricultural productivity and food security.

Poor ICT policies that hinder the adoption of agricultural technologies in developing countries are often characterized by the following challenges:

1. **Lack of Access to ICT Infrastructure**: In many developing countries, the ICT infrastructure is often inadequate. This can include limited access to the internet, lack of electricity in rural areas, and limited access to smartphones and computers. These factors can hinder the adoption of agricultural technologies that rely on these infrastructures [Source 0](https://pim.cgiar.org/2021/12/30/information-and-communications-technology-and-agricultural-extension-in-developing-countries/).

2. **Limited Digital Literacy**: Many farmers in developing countries may lack the necessary skills to use digital technologies. This can be due to a lack of education or training, language barriers, or simply a lack of exposure to these technologies. This makes it difficult for these farmers to adopt and benefit from digital agricultural technologies [Source 0](https://pim.cgiar.org/2021/12/30/information-and-communications-technology-and-agricultural-extension-in-developing-countries/).

3. **Poorly Designed ICT Services**: Some ICT services may not be designed with the needs of farmers in mind. For instance, they might not be available in local languages or they might not be user-friendly for people with limited digital literacy. Moreover, some ICT services might not provide the types of information that farmers find useful. This can discourage farmers from using these services [Source 0](https://pim.cgiar.org/2021/12/30/information-and-communications-technology-and-agricultural-extension-in-developing-countries/).

4. **Lack of Trust in Digital Technologies**: Farmers might be hesitant to adopt digital technologies due to concerns about data privacy or doubts about the reliability of the information provided by these technologies. This lack of trust can be a significant barrier to the adoption of agricultural technologies [Source 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2022.972667/full).

5. **Inadequate Regulatory Frameworks**: In some cases, the regulatory frameworks for ICT in agriculture might be inadequate or non-existent. This can create uncertainty for farmers and other stakeholders, making it difficult for them to adopt and invest in these technologies [Source 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2022.972667/full).

Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes improving ICT infrastructure, providing training and education to farmers, designing user-friendly and relevant ICT services, building trust in digital technologies, and developing robust regulatory frameworks for ICT in agriculture.
