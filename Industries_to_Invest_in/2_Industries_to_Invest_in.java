Based on the sources provided, here are some specific strategies that Kenya could adopt to increase manufacturing and job creation, develop a skilled labor force, and promote research and innovation.

1. Industries to Invest in: 

    - Information Technology: Kenya has been noted as the tech hub of Africa, also known as the 'Silicon Savannah'. Investing in IT could lead to job creation, especially for the youth [Source 4](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/harnessing-innovation-job-creation/).
    - Mining: The mining and quarrying sector contributed approximately $773 million to Kenya's GDP in 2021 [Source 5](https://www.nexford.edu/insights/skills-supply-and-skills-demand-in-the-kenyan-economy).
    - Manufacturing: The manufacturing sector added approximately $7.4 billion to Kenya's GDP in 2021 [Source 5](https://www.nexford.edu/insights/skills-supply-and-skills-demand-in-the-kenyan-economy).
    - Construction: The construction sector contributed approximately $7 billion to Kenya's GDP in 2021 [Source 5](https://www.nexford.edu/insights/skills-supply-and-skills-demand-in-the-kenyan-economy).

2. TVET Institutions and Technical Knowledge:

    - Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions are crucial for developing a skilled labor force. The curriculum should be adjusted to include task-based activities to prepare students for work after graduation [Source 3](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/kenya/publication/kenya-economic-update-more-productive-jobs-hold-the-key-to-kenya-s-resilient-recovery-from-the-covid-19-pandemic).
    - Kenya could focus on skills that are in-demand in the job market. For example, socio-emotional skills, cognitive skills, technical skills, and ICT skills are important for increasing employment and earnings [Source 3](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/kenya/publication/kenya-economic-update-more-productive-jobs-hold-the-key-to-kenya-s-resilient-recovery-from-the-covid-19-pandemic).

3. Agricultural Techniques:

    - As a significant portion of Kenyans work in agriculture, it's important to invest in modern and efficient farming techniques. This could include irrigation systems, mechanization, and sustainable farming practices.
    - Value addition to agricultural products could also be a strategy to increase the income of farmers and reduce reliance on raw agricultural exports.

4. Promotion of Research and Innovation:

    - Kenya could establish research and development (R&D) centers to promote innovation. This could involve partnerships between universities, research institutions, and the private sector.
    - The government could provide incentives such as grants and tax breaks to encourage R&D activities.

5. Infrastructure Development:

    - Investment in infrastructure such as roads, ports, electricity, and telecommunications is crucial for attracting investment and supporting manufacturing industries.

6. Funding for SMEs:

    - The government could establish a fund to provide low-interest loans to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This would help SMEs to grow and contribute to industrial development.
    - Other support for SMEs could include business development services, mentorship programs, and access to markets.

Remember, these are just some general strategies and they would need to be tailored to the specific context of Kenya. A comprehensive and well-implemented strategy would be crucial for successful industrial development and job creation.
