Transforming a nation's economy from agriculture-dependent to a manufacturing and services hub is a complex and long-term process. Your theory about corruption, taxes, lack of specialized labor, and lack of investors playing a role is valid, as these are some of the challenges Kenya, like many other developing nations, faces. Here are some recommendations on how Kenya can work towards becoming a manufacturing and services hub:

1. **Strengthen the Business Environment**:
   - Address corruption by improving transparency, enforcing anti-corruption laws, and creating a culture of accountability.
   - Simplify tax procedures and offer incentives to attract foreign and domestic investors.
   - Streamline regulations and bureaucracy to make it easier for businesses to operate.

2. **Invest in Education and Skills Development**:
   - Focus on education and vocational training to develop a skilled workforce. This will attract investors looking for specialized labor.
   - Encourage technical and vocational education and training (TVET) to bridge the skills gap in manufacturing and services.

3. **Infrastructure Development**:
   - Invest in infrastructure like roads, ports, and energy to reduce the cost of doing business.
   - Develop special economic zones (SEZs) to attract manufacturers and service providers.

4. **Access to Finance**:
   - Create financial instruments and mechanisms to provide easier access to capital for entrepreneurs and businesses.
   - Promote financial inclusion to reach the rural population with banking and financial services.

5. **Agriculture Diversification**:
   - Promote value addition in agriculture, turning raw products into processed goods for local and export markets.
   - Encourage crop diversification and modern farming techniques.

6. **Innovation and Research**:
   - Invest in research and development to spur innovation in manufacturing and services.
   - Develop partnerships between universities, research institutions, and industries to support innovation.

7. **Trade Agreements and Export Promotion**:
   - Negotiate trade agreements that provide favorable conditions for Kenyan exports.
   - Promote Kenyan goods and services internationally to attract foreign investment.

8. **Quality Control and Standards**:
   - Implement and enforce quality control standards to ensure that Kenyan products meet international standards.
   - Develop institutions responsible for standardization and quality assurance.

9. **Entrepreneurship and Small Businesses**:
   - Support and promote entrepreneurship through funding, mentorship, and training programs.
   - Create a conducive environment for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to thrive.

10. **Infrastructure for Technology and Connectivity**:
    - Invest in digital infrastructure to enhance connectivity and access to the internet.
    - Promote e-commerce and digital services to reach a wider market.

11. **Political Stability and Good Governance**:
    - Maintain political stability and good governance to create a conducive environment for investment.
    - Ensure the rule of law and protection of property rights.

12. **Public-Private Partnerships**:
    - Foster collaboration between the public and private sectors to develop projects, infrastructure, and policies that support economic diversification.

The transformation from an agriculture-dependent economy to a manufacturing and services hub will take time and require the commitment of the government, businesses, and civil society. It's important to focus on sustainable development that benefits all segments of the population and regions of the country, including those in rural areas. Learning from the experiences of countries like Singapore and leveraging global best practices can be invaluable in this journey.
