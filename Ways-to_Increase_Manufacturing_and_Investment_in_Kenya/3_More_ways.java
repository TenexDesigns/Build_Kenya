It seems like you're asking for advice on how Kenya can increase its manufacturing sector and reduce its reliance on agriculture. Corruption, taxes, lack of specialized labor, and lack of investors are some factors that you believe contribute to this issue. To help you with your question, I will provide some suggestions on what Kenya can do to become a manufacturing and investment hub like Singapore.

1. Improve Infrastructure: Enhancing transportation networks, power supply, and logistics infrastructure is crucial for attracting manufacturing industries. This includes investing in roads, ports, airports, and reliable electricity supply.

2. Develop Special Economic Zones (SEZs): Establishing SEZs can provide tax incentives, streamlined regulations, and infrastructure support to attract both local and foreign investors. These zones can focus on specific industries and provide a conducive environment for manufacturing and services.

3. Enhance Education and Skills Development: To address the lack of specialized labor, Kenya should invest in education and skills development programs. This includes promoting technical and vocational training, as well as collaborating with industries to provide relevant training and apprenticeship programs.

4. Encourage Research and Development: Promoting innovation and research can help Kenya develop new technologies and products. This can be achieved through partnerships between universities, research institutions, and the private sector.

5. Streamline Business Regulations: Simplifying and reducing bureaucratic processes can attract investors and make it easier for businesses to operate. This includes improving the ease of doing business, reducing corruption, and ensuring transparent and efficient government procedures.

6. Promote Investment and Trade: Kenya should actively promote itself as an attractive investment destination. This can be done through targeted marketing campaigns, participating in trade exhibitions, and offering incentives for foreign direct investment.

7. Support Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): SMEs play a crucial role in the manufacturing sector. Providing access to finance, business development services, and mentorship programs can help SMEs grow and contribute to the overall industrial development.

8. Diversify Export Markets: Kenya should explore new export markets beyond traditional agricultural products. This can involve promoting manufactured goods, services, and value-added agricultural products to expand the country's export base.

9. Foster Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between the government and private sector is essential for industrial development. This can involve joint ventures, public-private partnerships, and industry-led initiatives to drive investment and innovation.

10. Create a Favorable Business Environment: Ensuring political stability, rule of law, and protection of intellectual property rights are crucial for attracting investment. Kenya should also focus on improving the ease of doing business rankings and addressing any concerns related to corruption and governance.

Its important to note that these suggestions are general and may require further analysis and customization to suit Kenya's specific context. Additionally, engaging with stakeholders, conducting feasibility studies, and implementing comprehensive policies and strategies are essential for successful industrial development.
